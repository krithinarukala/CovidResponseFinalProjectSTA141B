__Part 4:__ Public Satisfaction

__Conclusion:__ Are the Covid-19 repsonse apporaches made by each country as effective as they are claiming them to be? Which response measures are the most effective? Are there possibly outside factors that may be affective response effectiveness? How can our findings be applied to our own communities? Where do we move on from here?
